# NYC Bike Analysis

## Overview of Project

### Purpose

The purpose of this analysis is to visualize bike-sharing data using Tableau. The goal is to show investors that a bike-sharing program
in Des Moines is a solid business proposal. First a csv file was imported into Tableau. The csv file contains data from the [Citi Bike System page](https://citibikenyc.com/system-data).
Then five visualizations were created and made into a story in Tableau.
